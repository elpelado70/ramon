<table align="center" cellpadding="10"><tr><td>Discovering the imprint left by the Empire of Genghis Khan and his progeny, we shall visit Karakorum. In the ancient capital of the Empire – one of UNESCO'S World Heritage cities- is located the Erdene Zuu Monastery, the first Tibetan Buddhist temple built towards the end of the sixteenth century. The first days of the journey coincide with the celebration of the Naadam Festival, the most relevant cultural, social and sporting event of Mongolia. The origins of this athletic competition go back to the times of Genghis Khan. It is composed of four tournaments: archery, wrestling, horse racing and jacks. We will witness the Festival in small towns since, due to a lesser touristic affluence, in them these ancestral traditions are preserved in a more authentic and lively fashion. We finish the journey returning to Ulán Bator, and from there, aboard the Trans-Siberian, travelling to Beijing.</td><td><img src="../images/descripcion_04.jpg" width="450" /></td></tr></table>
