It was the farthest reaching Empire mankind has ever known. With its fall, the Empire also lost its independence and was assimilated by Manchuria during the end of the seventeenth century until 1911. In 1919 it falls again under Chinese occupation. In 1921 the White Russian troops who were retreating under the command of Baron von Ungern-Sternberg ("The Crazy Baron") occupy Urga (at present Ulan Baatar), declare the independence of Mongolia, reinstating the Bogd Khan as a decorative ruler. The Mongolian people, tired of the Baron's bloodthirsty regime, together with the Bolshevik troops and with their national hero, Damdin SÃ¼khbatar, leading them, defeat the White Russians. Later, in 1924 the Popular Republic of Mongolia is proclaimed, becoming thus the second country in the world to adopt communist policies, and is virtually occupied by the Soviet Union. In fact it was called the "sixteenth Republic". After the perestroika in 1990, Mongolia chooses a democratic parliamentary Constitution and simply renames itself Mongolia.</td></tr></table>
