It covers 7661 kilometers from Moscow to Beijing, makes 49 stops which can last from two minutes to two hours, including those of Naushki and Erlian, the borders of Mongolia with Russia and China respectively. The width of the wheels is changed at these stops, so as to adapt them to the different gauges in these two countries. At regular intervals along the way, the engines are changed, the bogies checked (by listening to the metallic sound produced when struck by a bar of steel) and the necessary supply of fresh water is pumped through hoses.</td><td><img src="../images/anexo_01.jpg" width="170" /></td></tr></table>
