The journey on the legendary train - 300 meters long, and which, just as the ancient caravans along the Silk Road, is shared by Russians, Mongols, Chinese and curious travelers-, lasts over 36 hours. Once we have reached Ulán Bator, we shall buy the motorcycles that will carry us for the rest of the voyage that will last between 45 and 60 days during the months of July and August 2011 –the Mongolian summer-. We will ride over 6,000 Km in bike.  </td></tr></table>
