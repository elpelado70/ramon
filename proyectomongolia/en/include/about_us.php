<table align="center" cellpadding="10"><tr><td>Although we start from different outlooks, we share a similar point of view of nomadism as a different sociocultural alternative, sadly destined to disappear. We agree with the theory of Professor Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza, who propounds that the pastoral nomadic lifestyle is not the previous instance to the sedentary, but that both situations occur simultaneously within the social development of the same ethnic group. Our working hypothesis is this reformulation of the nomadic lifestyle. We believe that it is essential to record and document its currently strongest manifestations: the Mongol nomadism and its toughest environment, the Gobi Desert. Since we are conscious that it is a culture which is destined to perish – mostly due to overpopulation, excessive industrialization, as well as the existent mercantilism-, we are bound to document this reality, this lifestyle so far removed in every sense from our concepts.

Let's not forget that these are the same nomads that not only founded the largest Empire that mankind has ever known, but also, thanks to the permanent harassment to which they submitted the Chinese, made it necessary to create that fabulous thoroughfare which during almost fifteen centuries communicated the Far East with the West, baptized with the name of Silk Road in the 19th century by the German geographer von Richtoffen. These are the same nomads that give origin to the Turkic migrations coming from Mongolia, as well as the invasions by Attila and Genghis Khan. The Mongolia Team attempt to circle the mystery of a magic culture on its way to extinction. The Team is composed by Rosario Cervio, Inés de Oliveira Cézar and Ramón de Oliveira Cézar. </td></tr></table>
