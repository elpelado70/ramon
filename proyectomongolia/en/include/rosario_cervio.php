These trips have one thing in common: plenty of enthusiasm and little money. This philosophy is applied in the extreme when she travels to Rome in 2006 with only six euros to last her a week. <br /><br />She develops an early passion for motorbikes. Her only siblings being brothers, she must adapt to their rhythms and tastes. <br />Her first bike is a Zanella Fire 50, that, at ten years of age, she buys and shares with her cousins. This one was followed by a Yamaha Axis, and a Honda XR 100. Presently she rides a humble Suzuki AX 100, with which she travels near and far. <br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="30"><td align="center"><a href="ines.php"><img src="../images/ines.jpg" width="100" border="0" /></a><br />Inés de Oliveira Cézar</td><td align="center"><a href="ramon.php"><img src="../images/ramon.jpg" width="100" border="0" /></a><br />Ramón de Oliveira Cézar</td></tr></table>
