<table align="center" cellpadding="10"><tr><td>We did not accidentally choose to travel on motorbikes: it's the most widespread means of transportation in Mongolia. We shall travel like a couple of local shepherds. We don't wish to interfere, we want to be integrated; the bike places us on an equal footing, giving us an easier access to the people. And we won't use just any brand or model; we have chosen the traditional IZH Planet 5, the most popular bike among the Mongols, to ride over 6,000 Km.</td><td><img src="../images/anexo_05.jpg" width="350" /></td></tr></table>
