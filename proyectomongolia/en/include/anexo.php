<table align="center" cellpadding="10"><tr><td>For Westerners there is only one Gobi Desert; the Mongols, on the other hand, can name more than thirty different ones. Together they encompass a third of Southern Mongolia and have one trait in common: their extraordinary thermal range, with temperatures that vary from 40 degrees centigrade in the summer to 40 below zero in winter. These conditions are made particularly tough by the fact that some low areas can go for years without a drop of rain, while the sand storms follow each other incessantly during the springtime, lasting sometimes up to 48 hours. The best known landscape of the Gobi is that of the dunes, which owe their reddish colouring to the iron oxide that covers the sand's quartz. The most emblematic animals of the Gobi are the Bactrian camels, which can be recognised by their bushy fur and two humps. Another valued species is the yak. The ibex (related to goats), the mouflon (a kind of ram) and the Mongolian gazelles, appreciated by wolves and snow leopards, stand out among other wild animals. A large part of the Gobi is protected. Even though its name in Mongol means "waterless place", one of the largest reservoirs of water of the planet can be found underneath this desert.</td><td><img src="../images/anexo_02.jpg" width="350" /></td></tr></table>
